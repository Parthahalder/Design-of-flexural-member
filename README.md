Project Overview:
This project includes a Python program designed to perform the structural design of flexural members in accordance with IS 800:2007. The program calculates the moment capacity, shear capacity, and checks deflection limits for a simply supported beam under a uniformly distributed load.

The following deliverables are included in this project:

Python Program: Fossee_partha.py

A Python script that reads input values from a .txt file, performs the necessary design checks (moment capacity, shear capacity, and deflection), and outputs the results in a separate .txt file.
Input File: input.txt
A text file containing the input values (moment, shear, effective span, width and height of cross section of beam) required for the design calculations.

Output File: output.txt
A text file generated by the Python program containing the design check results (moment capacity, shear capacity, deflection check) and giving conclusion for safe design.

Design Report: Design_Report.pdf
A detailed report explaining the design methodology, codal recommendations (IS 800:2007), the theory behind the design checks, and a step-by-step explanation of the program's algorithm.

README File: README.txt
This file, which provides details about the project structure, author details, and required deliverables.
